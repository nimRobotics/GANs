### Usage
  <!-- - To start the GUI run the `gui.py`file i.e.`python3 gui.py` from the command line
  - The resultant data is stored in `res.txt` along with the time stamp
  - Please refer to the documentation to see the algorithm and calculations [DME_Project_Report_SpriD.pdf](https://github.com/AakashSYadav/SpriD/tree/master/report/DME_Project_Report_SpriD.pdf)
  - To see the simulation run the `sim.py` (Note: At present the simulation is not binded to the main GUI)
